I'm Full Stack Solution Architect. The crossover between design and programming has always been of interest to me, I've been lucky enough to work alongside some talented teams on a number of high profile websites. I have a wide range of skills that include back-end development using open source technologies (NodeJs), design (working closely with designers), front-end development (HTML5, CSS3, Javascript, Responsive, UX),database(MongoDB).
